# Process_ImgRucoy


This project is entirely academic, aimed at putting into practice the programming knowledge acquired in a self-taught manner to prove my skills. That said, let's move on to the project presentation.

Rucoy is an MMORPG game created by RicardoGzz, with over 5 million downloads on Google Play. One of the tasks that players must undertake is character training, but this is an arduous task that takes days to years to reach a skill level that makes a difference. This is where the need to create a bot that trains the character arose. There are already many tools that do the training, but they are all inadequate.

 ## Specifications
 The game was created for cell phones, but to run the bot you need a computer that
 runs an emulator and python version 3.1. I recommend a maximum of 2 screens for low-performance computers. The algorithmcreated can run infinite amounts of screen just depends on the screen space and
 hardware processing. Because it uses Autogui, it cannot be minimized.

 ## Banning
 We kindly ask that you refrain from using bots in online games. Doing so is in violation of the Terms of Use established by the game developers. Additionally, the use of bots can impact the economy and the overall 
 player experience. It creates an unbalanced environment where some players progress faster without the same effort. When a player is caught using bots, the consequences usually include the suspension or banning of 
 the account.
